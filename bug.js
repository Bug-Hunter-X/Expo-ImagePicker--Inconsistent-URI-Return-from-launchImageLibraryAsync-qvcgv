This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue is that the library sometimes fails to return an image uri after the user selects an image from their device's gallery. The picker appears to function normally, but the promise returned by `launchImageLibraryAsync` resolves to an object with an empty `uri` property, resulting in an unexpected null or undefined value when you try to access the selected image.
